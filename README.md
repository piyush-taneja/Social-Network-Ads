                                                             Social-Network-Ads
The goal is to predict whether the customer will buy the Sedan car using the different Classification models like Logistic , K-Nearest Neighbors(K-NN), Support Vector Machines(SVM), Kernel SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree Classification and Randm Forest Classification.
This dataset contains information of users in a social network. So these informations are the user id, the gender, the age and the estimated salary and this social network has several buisness clients which can put their ads on the social network and one of their clients is a car company who has just launched their brand new luxuary sedan car for a ridiculous price. And we are trying to see which of these users of the social network are going to buy this brand new sedan. And so the last column here tells if 'yes' or 'no' the user bought this sedan we are going to build  a model that is going to buy or not the sedan based on two variables which are going to be the age and the estimated salary.
